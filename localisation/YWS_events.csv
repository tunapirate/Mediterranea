EVTDESCYWS.1001;Thick clouds of soot and ash blown from the west lay siege to the open sky, and have obscured the heavenly element over all of Europa and beyond. Sunlight only weakly filters through, casting a pall over the land—even at noon it seems only like evening. To complement the omnipresent gloom, the falling ash has laid a thin blanket over castles, churches, and farms alike. The peasantry take this to be an omen of great and ill import, and unrest fills the countryside as itinerant prophets declare this to be the end of times. The clouds, ominously, show no sign of receding anytime soon.;Clouds of soot and ash blown from the west have obscured the heavenly element all over Europa, and sunlight only weakly filters through.
